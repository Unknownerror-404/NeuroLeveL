# NeuroLeveL
NeuroLeveL v1 introduces a novel, perceptron-inspired approach to leveling systems. Unlike traditional bots that rely on linear, static, or quadratic XP formulas, NeuroLeveL dynamically distributes XP based on both **recent server activity** and **user contribution ratios**.
Originally extracted from its parent bot **Jason**, this open-source module is now modularized for public use. It is fully customizable, allowing developers to adjust the behavior, scaling, and weighting logic to suit their own servers or bots.

## Features
- Activity-aware XP calculation
- Leveling system with scaling
- Leaderboard support
- MongoDB integration
- Dependent on user activity and participation relative to server activity.
- Encourages silent warriores while inherently discouraging spamming.
- Inbuilt spam control.

### Use Cases:
Perfect for Discord communities that want:
- Fairer engagement systems
- Anti-spam leveling
- Smarter reward logic based on real interaction
