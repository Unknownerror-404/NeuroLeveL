# NeuroLeveL
NeuroLeveL is a lightweight framework for adaptive XP handling in Discord bots. While most bots rely on linear, quadratic, or static XP formulas, NeuroLeveL introduces a perceptron-inspired logic that dynamically calculates and distributes XP based on recent server and user activity.
## Features
- Activity-aware XP calculation
- Leveling system with scaling
- Leaderboard support
- MongoDB integration
- Dependent on user activity and participation relative to server activity.
- Encourages silent warriores while inherently discouraging spamming.
- Inbuilt spam control.
