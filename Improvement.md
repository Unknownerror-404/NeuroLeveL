# Improvements to be implemented:
-Make the pereceptron like code more like an actual perceptron.
-Addition of XP caps.
-Optimization of database updates, making sequential processing more efficient by implementing batch or parallel processing updates.
-Pull out portd to weights and biases to the discord chat in itself rather than the implicit ones in the code.
-Addition of ADAM-analogous optimizers.
-Freindly Debug logs.
