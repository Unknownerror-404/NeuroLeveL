### Update Notes / Dev logs:
- *version update* 1.01.0 : Updated the weights of logical perceptron to depend on user and msg ratios, and pass it through a sigmoid function to clamp it between 0 to 1, the values are changable but have been set at default values. This makes the code more dynamic and reactive when compared to the earlier hard coded stiff version.
